# tinynamespace
tiny namespace php framework(TNSF) is tiny php framework for who wanna create a static page with PHP in a short period.
I love PHP language some days. This framework will force you to follow OOP concept like Java language.
OOP concept will make you happy and smile to your 1024 x 768 pixel.

By any ways, it was bornt with MVC pattern plus security.

Note:
- Every class file no need to code "require or include"; the engine will interpret your class and found it in your source code, 
you just use "using namespace\yourclass as something;" it will be enough.
- Every class name has to write namespace, this will declare your class to TNSF engine to interpret.
- It does not need you to register the new class name in a file configuration.


Hope you will enjoy it!!
